            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE <hi>GENTLEMAN</hi>'s <hi rend="blackletterType">Letter to his Friend:</hi> SHEWING THAT BISHOPS MAY BE JUDGES IN CAUSES CAPITAL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thank you for the Gentleman's Letter you ſent me, touching <hi>the Right of Biſhops ſitting as Judges in Caſes Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> This <hi>Order</hi> of Men is not Sacred enough, it ſeems, in the Conſtitution, to ſecure it againſt (the Iniquity of theſe laſt Times) Attempts of Rage and Extirpation.</p>
            <p>Not to mention <hi>Martin Mar-Prelates,</hi> nor others of former Times; within our own Memory, Mr. <hi>Prym</hi> led up the Van againſt them (1640.) in a Book of this Title, <hi>viz. [Lord-Biſhops, none of the Lords Biſhops.]</hi> After their <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Conſtitution, they began to queſtion their <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Sit</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi> This occaſioned that <hi>Quodlibetical</hi> Queſtion, <hi>[Whether the Biſhops make a Fundamental and Eſſential part of the</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66520:3"/>Engliſh <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Rational and Solid <hi>Anſwer</hi> to which Queſtion was Printed in 1661, and now Reprinted (as then put forth at firſt) <hi>for the Information of ſome, the Confirmation of others, and the ſatisfaction of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> who wrote this Letter, ſeems to grant the Biſhops a large ſhare of Power within this Kingdom; yet as to <hi>Secular</hi> Matters, he does inſinuate ſome kind of <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they are ſuppoſed to lie under, though his Arguments are very inconſequent to prove it. The <hi>Reſcript</hi> of <hi>Honorius</hi> (he ſaith) &amp; <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> forbid them to have to do <hi>in Secular Matters?</hi> Therefore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> (who are of another Mind, upon good experience of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fidelity) may <hi>not admit</hi> them <hi>to have any Communion with Publick Functions:</hi> Nor is the Argument leſs inconſequent, which the <hi>Gentleman</hi> inſinuates from the Apoſtles Declaration and Practice. The Argument muſt be this, A few men are appointed by our Lord to propagate the Goſpel, and plant the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> all the world over; and they think it unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they ſhould neglect this generous Employment (impos'd upon them immediately from Heaven, <hi>to ſerve Tables,</hi> that is, to relieve the Temporal Needs of indigent Diſciples) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Church is generally eſtabliſhed, Biſhops ſetled in every <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> and Miniſters in every <hi>Pariſh,</hi> it is equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that the King ſhould intruſt any of the <hi>Clergy</hi> with any <hi>Secular Employments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after theſe <hi>By-blows,</hi> this <hi>Gentleman</hi> tells us, <hi>This is none of his buſineſs</hi> (which he had therefore done better to have let alone;) 'Tis the <hi>Critical</hi> point he ſtands upon, which he calls <hi>Vexata Quaestio,</hi> what is to be done in Parliament, that is, in <hi>their Judicial way</hi> upon <hi>Trials,</hi> not in their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Capacity, paſſing Acts of <hi>Attainder,</hi> in which the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is pleaſed to confeſs [<hi>I know that Biſhops have born a part; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is not now the Queſtion, but only this, Whether the Lords Spiritual have a Right to ſtay and ſit in Court, till the Court proceeds to the Vote of Guilty, or Not Guilty.</hi>] This <hi>Gentleman</hi> concludes, They <hi>ought not.</hi> But the Queſtion truly and preciſely ſtated, is only this; Whether <hi>of Right</hi> they <hi>may</hi> or <hi>may not?</hi> And having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examined what hath been ſaid on both ſides (as the <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath adviſed me) I profeſs to differ from him, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſufficient Reaſon to change my Opinion, which is for the <hi>Affirmative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the better to carry on his <hi>Negative,</hi> this <hi>Gentleman</hi> falls upon <hi>Two Queſtions</hi> more, which may be thought <hi>preliminary</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66520:3"/>to this other. The Firſt is, touching the <hi>Peerage</hi> of the Lords Spiritual: The Second, Whether they make a <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> in Parliament? Theſe two fall in <hi>collaterally,</hi> and muſt be conſidered before we fall upon his main <hi>Battalia,</hi> muſtered up for the Defence of the Opinion we oppugn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Biſhops make a <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> in Parliament, there is very much alledged in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> forementioned (from the Examples of all Chriſtian Kingdoms of the <hi>Gothick Model,</hi> from <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> the Parliament-<hi>Rolls</hi> of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, and the <hi>Recognition</hi> of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal with the Commons, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 3. &amp; 8. and what is argued from thence, <hi>p.</hi> 16, 17. of <hi>the Rebels Plea,</hi> Printed 1660.) to which I ſhall add that Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> in his <hi>Grand Abridgment,</hi> and the Word <hi>Parliament</hi> tells us, That <hi>the Parliament in</hi> England <hi>is the Aſſembly of the King and the Three Eſtates of the Realm,</hi> viz. <hi>the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the Commons.</hi> And this <hi>Gentleman</hi> does acknowledge (<hi>p.</hi> 86) that <hi>the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>are divided into Three Eſtates, The Nobility the Clergy, and the Commonalty.</hi> Theſe, he ſaith, are the ſeveral <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the Kingdom. But if the Biſhops be not <hi>One</hi> of theſe <hi>Eſtates,</hi> then one of the <hi>Three Estates</hi> of the Kingdom is not <hi>Repreſented</hi> at all in Parliament (for he ſaith, (<hi>p.</hi> 88.) that <hi>the Convocation where all the Clergy are preſent in their</hi> Perſons, <hi>or their</hi> Repreſentatives, <hi>is no part of the Parliament,</hi>) which is abſurd. The Authority of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ay, is moſt conſonant to Reaſon; and the Practice at the <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Peace</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> King, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 5. &amp; 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. are further Confirmations of it.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſaith (<hi>p.</hi> 88.) <hi>The Three Estates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are clean another thing; each muſt have a Negative Voice to all that paſſeth there:</hi> I might take notice by the By of his Miſtake herein; for there is nothing paſſeth where uſe is made of the <hi>Negative</hi> Voice: but <hi>I</hi> muſt obſerve, that this is a cleanly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Queſtion. As for the Biſhops being <hi>intermingled</hi> with the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> and ſo if they be an <hi>Estate,</hi> it is an <hi>Eſtate</hi> within an <hi>Eſtate, like a Nest of Boxes, one within another,</hi> there is no abſurdity at all in it: for when <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd (not to recur to the time when all the Members of Parliament ſate in one Houſe together) the Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe times thought the <hi>State</hi> of the Church (with all its Rights and Intereſt) <hi>ſafe</hi> enough among the <hi>Nobility,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any peculiar <hi>Negative</hi> voice to ſecure it; and yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Proteſting</hi> (upon juſt occaſion) ſerves very well inſtead of ſuch a <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66520:4"/>
            <p>But this <hi>Gentleman</hi> thinks it would be <hi>a great Diſparagement</hi> to the <hi>Peerage</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Two Eſtates</hi> muſt be put together, to keep the <hi>Ballance even</hi> with the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> who are but <hi>One</hi> Eſtate; and that <hi>their Two ſhould ſignifie no more than that One:</hi> (taking no notice how much more they ſignifie, though they do very much,) To this I anſwer in the general, That <hi>Numbers</hi> of perſons add no <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Priviledge</hi> to <hi>a Politick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:</hi> The <hi>Peerage</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had the ſame Power arid Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity when they were not half ſo Numerous.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular, Experience tells us (and we have an Inſtance too freſh in memory) That neither the Biſhops <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> nor the Temporal Lords <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> nor the Kings <hi>Le Roy S'aviſera,</hi> are ſufficient to hold the Ballance even when the Commons depart from the Principles of Honour, Juſtice, and Loyalty. And as they never pretended to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> ſo have they not always been obſerved to be ſo <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>ſteddy</hi> in their Proceedings, as becomes the Wiſdom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſo Grave and Solemn a Convention. In 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. they deſired, that the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> the King's <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> (for pretended Oppreſſion) might loſe <hi>all his Offices, and be no longer of the King's Council;</hi> which the King granted; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3. at the Requeſt of the <hi>Commons</hi> themſelves, <hi>he was reſtored to all, and declared innocent.</hi> This <hi>Gentleman</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this their <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> (attended with ſo much <hi>Levity</hi>) that he could not paſs it by, without ſetting ſome Remark upon it, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Juſtice, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> governs their Debates and Reſolutions, we may put the King, and (to uſe his own Illuſtration) all <hi>the Three Eſtates</hi> of Parliament into the ſame <hi>Nest of Boxes,</hi> and yet their reſpective <hi>Interests</hi> (which is the <hi>Interest</hi> of the whole Kingdom interwoven) will be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> and preſerv'd inviolate.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Gentleman</hi> tells us further, That <hi>if the Biſhops be one of the Three Eſtates, nothing can paſs in</hi> Parliament <hi>without them.</hi> This may be generally true among States <hi>coordinate,</hi> without a <hi>Sovereign Head</hi> over them; and when a <hi>Rival</hi> is ſet up, to give <hi>Check-mate</hi> to the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority, as it was in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. mentioned by this Gentleman (at <hi>p.</hi> 92. when the Queſtion was <hi>[To whom the Supream Jurisdiction did belong, to the King, or to the Pope?]</hi> (In the time of ſuch a <hi>Competition,</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> is obliged to ſecure it ſelf againſt ſuch an <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> and does moſt juſtly abandon the <hi>Clergy</hi> that ſides with it.</p>
            <p>But 2. If <hi>Acts</hi> have paſſed without the Biſhops, they have

                  <hi>p.</hi> 93. to 98.</note> I refer you to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the <hi>Quodlibetical</hi> Queſtion for your ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>That King <hi>James</hi> was of this Judgment, is evident from the very Words and Speech produced by this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>The Parliament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is compoſed of a Head and a Body; The Head is the King, the Body are the Members of the Parliament: This Body again is ſubdivided into two parts; the Upper and the Lower Houſe; the Upper Houſe compounded partly of Nobility, Temporal men, who are Hereditable Counſellors to the</hi> High Court <hi>of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Honour of their Creation and Lands; and partly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Spiritual men, who are likewiſe by virtue of their Place and Dignity, Counſellors</hi> ad vitam, <hi>Life-Renters of this Court. The other Houſe is compos'd of Knights for the Shires, and Gentry and Burgeſſes for the Towns.</hi>] Here we ſee, though the King makes but <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> yet he does clearly diſtinguiſh them into <hi>Three Estates,</hi> though he does not call them ſo.</p>
            <p>To what is ſaid by <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Finch,</hi> I oppoſe the Teſtimonies of <hi>Livy, Selden, Cooke</hi> and <hi>Sheppard:</hi> To the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66520:5"/>Expreſſions of the Late <hi>King</hi> of B. <hi>Memory,</hi> in his Anſwer to the 19 <hi>Propoſ.</hi> (when he was fluctuating in the midſt of a Storm ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering round about him,) and to the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Commons, 2</hi> H. 4. <hi>n.</hi> 32. I might Anſwer, That the <hi>Upper Houſe,</hi> in a <hi>large ſenſe</hi> conſiſting of Lords Spiritual and Temporal ſitting and voting together) may be taken for <hi>One</hi> Eſtate: But taken <hi>preciſely,</hi> and in <hi>a ſtrict ſenſe,</hi> as their Concerns and Intereſts are diſtinct, ſo they are clearly <hi>Two.</hi> But to thoſe Authorities, I ſhall rather oppoſe the Act of <hi>Recognition;</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 3. Where the <hi>Lords</hi> Spiritual and Temporal, and the <hi>Commons</hi> in that Parliament Aſſembled, do <hi>Recognize</hi> the Queens Majeſty to be their true, lawful, and undoubted Sovereign Lieged Lady and Queen in theſe words, [<hi>We Your moſt Faithful, Loving, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Subjects, repreſenting the</hi> Three Eſtates <hi>of this Realm</hi>] which evidently ſheweth the <hi>Queen</hi> was not (there) eſteemed one. So when the Funerals of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. were ended, the <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> did Aſſembled and Acknowledge his Son King. To think to elude ſuch Evidence, by ſaying (as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> does in the like caſe) that ſuch Expreſſions are delivered <hi>obiter,</hi> upon the By, is to make, what we fancy not, in any <hi>Statute,</hi> utterly <hi>void,</hi> and of none effect.</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion concerns the Biſhops <hi>Peerage;</hi> For the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> we have theſe things to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Prelates are called by the ſame <hi>Writ</hi> (for <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi>) with that directed to the <hi>Temporal</hi> Barons: ſo the Anſwer to the <hi>Quodlibetical Queſtion:</hi> That they Sit and Vote there by a <hi>double capacity;</hi> as <hi>Biſhops</hi> firſt, in reference to their ſeveral <hi>Sees;</hi> and ſecondly, as <hi>Peers,</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Hereupon they affirm to the Lords <hi>Temporal</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden at <hi>Northampton Hen.</hi> 2. as <hi>Selden</hi> reports, <hi>We ſit not here as Biſhops only, but as Barons; we are Barons, and you are Barons; here we ſit as Peers.</hi> And ſome <hi>Statutes</hi> call them <hi>Peers</hi> of the Land <hi>in terminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis his <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Title, <hi>Primus Par Angliae.</hi> That the <hi>firſt Peer</hi> ſhould be no <hi>Peer,</hi> is an unheard of Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. If he be a <hi>Peer,</hi> the reſt of the Biſhops are his <hi>Com-peers,</hi> what ever they are to the Lords <hi>Temporal. John Stratford</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that place, in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3, claim'd this Priviledge in the Right of his <hi>See.</hi> And the Proteſtat. of <hi>W. Courtney,</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned, with the reſt of the Biſhops, is another pregnant Evidence to this purpoſe. And 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The Prelates put up this Petition to the King (as the <hi>Gentleman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf relates it, <hi>p.</hi> 83.) <hi>Seeing Archbiſhops and Biſhops hold their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66520:5"/>of the King</hi> in capite, <hi>and therefore are</hi> Peers <hi>of the Land as other Earls and Barons are, that you will be pleaſed to grant unto them, that no Judge may henceforward, for meer contempts, cauſe their</hi> Temporalties <hi>to be ſeized.</hi> Here we have a <hi>Prayer,</hi> that their <hi>Temporalties</hi> may not be <hi>ſeized,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it; becauſe they are <hi>Peers,</hi> as <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> are. The King grants their <hi>Petition,</hi> and <hi>allows</hi> the Reaſon. The King cannot err in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;</hi> his <hi>Allowance</hi> therefore is a ſufficient <hi>confirmation</hi> of their <hi>Peerage.</hi> And this <hi>Gentleman, p.</hi> 93, &amp;c. when he argues againſt their being a <hi>third Eſtate,</hi> he tells us, <hi>William the firſt erected the temporalties of Biſhops into</hi> Baronies, <hi>to hold</hi> in capite; <hi>and upon account of thoſe</hi> Baronies, <hi>both the</hi> Temporal <hi>Lords and</hi> Spiritual <hi>had of right place in Parliament, and were bound to ſerve him there. They were all</hi> Foedal Barons, <hi>all holding by one tenure, and by that tenure ſitting in</hi> Parliament. And a little after he ſaith, <hi>They are ſtill qualifi'd to be Members of</hi> Parliament, <hi>as before, a Baron ſate as a Baron, an Earl as an Earl. Being made by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or by Writ, or by holding ſuch a proportion of Land, alters not the Caſe as to their ſitting in</hi> Parliament; <hi>for it is being of ſuch a degree which makes them</hi> Peers <hi>of</hi> Parliament.] One would think this is cleer enough for the Biſhops <hi>Peerage.</hi> But beſides, either the Biſhops ſit in Parliament as <hi>Peers,</hi> or as <hi>Commoners:</hi> if as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,</hi> then his own Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 90. will be return'd upon him; <hi>Would it be for the Honour of the Houſe of Lords, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners muſt be put to them, to keep the Ballance even with the Houſe of Commons? And moſt clearly it would be a Diſparagement to the Peerage of the Kingdom, the Temporal Lords, and would make them to be a poor Eſtate, that a number of Commoners muſt be joyn'd to them, to make up their</hi> Negative Voice, <hi>and ſet them upon even ground with the Houſe of</hi> Commons. But the truth is, the Biſhops Sit and Vote in Parliament (as we ſaid afore) by a <hi>double capacity;</hi> as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> firſt, in reference to their ſeveral <hi>Sees;</hi> and ſecondly, as <hi>Peers,</hi> in regard of their <hi>Baronies.</hi> All the Lords are <hi>equal</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>Peerage,</hi> and ſo they make up but <hi>one Houſe;</hi> but they are diſtinguiſh'd by their <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> reſpectively, and ſo they make up <hi>two Eſtates</hi> diſtinct and different.</p>
            <p>But to prove that they are no <hi>Peers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 85. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.</note> this <hi>Gentheman</hi> fetches an Argument from <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, I know it ſaith, <hi>Every man that is tried at the King's Suit, muſt be tried by his Peers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be <hi>Amerced,</hi> or <hi>Impriſoned,</hi> or <hi>Diſſeiſed,</hi> or <hi>Outlaw'd,</hi> &amp;c. it muſt be <hi>by his Peers.</hi> But this Argument makes clear againſt him; for he himſelf informs us, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12. that the Lord <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi> who was the King's <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> for Oppreſſion in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66520:6"/>places in <hi>Britain,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> was by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> adjudged to be <hi>impriſoned,</hi> and put to <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Ranſom;</hi> and the Lord <hi>John Nevil,</hi> a <hi>Privy Counſellor;</hi> for buying ſome Debts due by the King, at eaſie Rates, to make advantage to himſelf: He mentions ſome <hi>others,</hi> and concludes; <hi>At all theſe Trials the Biſhops were preſent, and no body ſayes but they might:</hi> which makes it evident (if the Law of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> were obſerved) that the Biſhops ſate as <hi>Peers</hi> in giving Judgment upon thoſe <hi>Culprit</hi>-Lords.</p>
            <p>But for all this, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath a very ſtrong Objection out of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> againſt the Biſhops <hi>Peerage;</hi> and 'tis this, If any Biſhop be tried for any <hi>Capital</hi> Offence,<note place="margin">

               <note n="*" place="margin">Privilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um perſonale amittitur, extincta perſona cui id conceſſum eſt. <hi>And ſuch perſons are reputed dead in Law.</hi>
               </note>, and by a <hi>Fiction of Law</hi> (not <hi>unuſual</hi>) <hi>dead</hi> in that capacity, <hi>diveſted of their Peerage with their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities,</hi> and ſo (being in the ſenſe of the Law reduced to that condition) they come to be tried as <hi>Commoners.</hi> And thus much for the Biſhops <hi>Peerage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For their <hi>Right</hi> to Sit as Judges in <hi>Caſes Capital,</hi> as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>It deſerves a ſtrict enquiry, and we ſhould do well to conſider upon what ground the Prelates were prohibited having Votes in Caſes of Blood.</hi> Such a Prohibition indeed is extant; but it is Authentical only in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> as we ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince anon: but this Law is <hi>Popiſh,</hi> grounded upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Superſtition, Uſurpation,</hi> and <hi>Papal Tyranny;</hi> and is very <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>uncharitable,</hi> according to the uſual practice of it.

            <p>In the Interim, I think to remove a great miſtake of this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> a <hi>Monk, one that would not be partial for the Lords Temporal in relating matters,</hi>

The Angels of Heaven think it no way diſagreeable, at Gods command, to inflict corporal puniſhments upon the wicked.

            <p n="2">2.

The Force of this <hi>Canon</hi> divided the <hi>Prelates</hi> of thoſe times between the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Pope;</hi> either they did not underſtand, or they did wilfully neglect their Duty; and ſome Inſtances of the miſchievous effects hereof this <hi>Gentleman</hi> gives us in his Letter. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>The Parliament was declared to be called for the redreſs of the Breach of the Laws, and of the Peace of the Kingdom.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66520:7"/>ſtop here; but the <hi>Gentleman</hi> tells us further, at <hi>p.</hi> 96.

               </q> Theſe, and the like Inſolencies were the Fruits of thoſe <hi>Immunities</hi> which the <hi>Prelates</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> times received by the <hi>Decrees</hi> of thoſe <hi>Holy Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>this</hi> Canon was grounded upon <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and did <hi>confront</hi> the Kings <hi>Supermacy,</hi> ſo the Practice of it (in thoſe times) was <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>uncharitable.</hi>

            <p>Firſt <hi>Irrational;</hi> for, 1. Why were the <hi>Prelates</hi> debarr'd the liberty of ſitting Judges in ſuch Caſes? Was it becauſe they wanted Knowledge, Reaſon, or Diſcretion?

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 38, 39.</note>
               <q>The Popiſh Biſhops did excommunicate and condemn him for an Heretick, and ſo turn'd him over to the Secular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>(for execution)</hi> yet certainly (<hi>ſaith this</hi> Gentlem. <hi>p.</hi> 39.) thoſe good men, I mean thoſe Popiſh Biſhops would have no more to do with him, as to his further Execution, that the World might ſee they were not men of Blood.</q> So that 'tis pretended at leaſt, that this <hi>Holy Canon</hi> (as they call it) was deſign'd for Caution, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> might have no <hi>hand in Blood;</hi> and yet the practice is ſo <hi>irrational,</hi> it does not ſufficiently prevent it. For in their <hi>Legiſlative capacity,</hi> this <hi>Gentleman</hi> grants, <hi>p.</hi> 3. that they may <hi>Sit,</hi> and <hi>Vote,</hi> and paſs <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Attainder</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">He ſaith p. <hi>51</hi> the E. of <hi>Straffords</hi> Trial was compleated that way.</note>. And, <hi>p.</hi> 104. <q>Acts of Attainder are Laws, and every Freeman is ſuppoſed to give his conſent to every Law, either by his Repreſentative, or in perſon, if a Memer of Parliament; and Biſhops being Members, may, I think <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> claim to do it perſonally.</q> And though there be a great ſtir about ſuch things as are <hi>preliminary,</hi> and <hi>preparatory to

            <p>Secondly, This practice of thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> times was <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable;</hi> for if the Biſhops were debarr'd ſitting as Judges in ſuch <hi>Caſes Capital,</hi> out of a <hi>ſuspition</hi> of their <hi>Integrity,</hi> it was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable</hi> to the Biſhops; if out of a jealouſie they might be too <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>yielding</hi> in their clemency, it were <hi>uncharitable</hi> to the <hi>Delinquent;</hi> if out of <hi>fear</hi> they might be too <hi>ſevere</hi> in point of Juſtice, it is <hi>uncharitable</hi> to the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> for Diſcretion ought to take her Rules from Charity, when <hi>Pity,</hi> and when <hi>Severity</hi> are to be uſed for the advantage of the Publick. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Justice</hi> may be provoked into <hi>Severity,</hi> and when <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are preferr'd with <hi>rigour,</hi> 'tis poſſible the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of ſuch grave and holy perſons intervening, a <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſable</hi> Sentence may be ſtopt and prevent a Deluge of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which might otherwiſe enſue.<note n="†" place="margin">See the Caſe, <hi>p. 26, 27, 28.</hi> of the Letter.</note> Had the Biſhops been preſent at <hi>Haxeye</hi>'s Trial, they might as well have prevented his Condemnation, as obtained his Pardon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canon-Law</hi> then gave the firſt <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>beginning</hi> to this Uſage (as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſeems to acknowledge, <hi>p.</hi> 68.) But the Ground of that <hi>Canon</hi> was <hi>Superstition,</hi> and it did <hi>confront</hi> the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and was <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> in the practice of it: Let us therefore examine what <hi>Force</hi> it had, and by what <hi>Authority.</hi> That this was in uſe while the <hi>Pope</hi> had a <hi>concurrent Jurisdiction</hi> here, cannot be denied; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever it received a <hi>Civil Sanction,</hi> and an <hi>expreſs Ratification,</hi> and had <hi>the ſtamp of Parliament-Authority ſet upon it,</hi> is the matter now in queſtion. And this I do ſtedfaſtly deny, and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> as earneſtly affirm and contend for.</p>
            <p>To prove this, he does alledge a <hi>double confirmation,</hi> and to give it the more <hi>Credit,</hi> he carries it up as high as the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. But I deſire the Reader to obſerve, that in the management of his Evidence, he turns an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66520:8"/>into a <hi>Prohibition;</hi> a <hi>Priviledge</hi> into a <hi>compleat Act</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> into a <hi>Statute.</hi>

For the <hi>Pope</hi> having then a <hi>concurrent Jurisdiction</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> was in <hi>force</hi> amongſt them; and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that <hi>the Lords Spiritual might not conſent to the Death of any man,</hi> they have reſpect to the <hi>Prohibition</hi> of the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> but this is not any the <hi>leaſt confirmation</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will needs have it confirmed by a <hi>Civil Sanction,</hi> and ſo become the Law of the Kingdom.</p>

               <note place="margin">p. <hi>69,</hi> &amp;c.</note> he ſaith, was about the time of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 2. amongſt the <hi>ſixteen Conſtitutions of</hi> Clarendon, <hi>which</hi> (beſides the Authority of Parliament (to make the Obſervation of them the more inviolable) <q>were eſtabliſhed by the Solemnity of an Oath,<note place="margin">

But the Caſe was this, upon the account of their <hi>Immunities,</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> eſpecially grew very <hi>remiſs</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> of their Duties (as was noted formerly.) Hereupon, in that <hi>Great Council (which was then their Parliament) amongſt the reſt,</hi> the King made this, (the 11th. of thoſe Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) <q>The Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp; univerſae perſonae Regni,</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 73.</note> Hereupon <hi>we may build our Faith, that there was</hi> really <hi>ſuch as Uſage</hi> (as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> infers) <hi>in ancient times, and that a liberty</hi> was left to continue it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Canon,</hi> and in veneration of it) but that 'twas <hi>ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed,</hi> we have not one Syllable to prove it.</p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Confirmation</hi> this <hi>Gentleman</hi> finds, was in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. upon the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> of the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 71, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> for himſelf and the other Biſhops. And here (after ſome <hi>fluctuation</hi> and <hi>unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>) <hi>p.</hi> 75. to make it a <hi>Law,</hi> he tells us, <q>The ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enacted did conſiſt of two Particulars; the one, That the Prelates had a Right to ſit and vote in all other Buſineſſes; <hi>the other,</hi> That they had no Right, nor was it lawful for them to be preſent in Parliament, when ſuch Buſineſſes were in queſtion: <hi>But the</hi> Tenour <hi>of their Proteſtation is,</hi> "That they intend to be preſent, to conſult, to treat of, and to determine, <hi>in omnibus,</hi> in all things, ſaving their Rights, their State and Dignity. <hi>But becauſe</hi> ſome things were to be tranſacted in that Parliament, at which, by the Decrees of the Sacred Canons, it was not lawful for them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally preſent, therefore they proteſted, that while ſuch things were in agitation, they would abſent themſelves. Which Proteſtation, being read in Full Parliament, at the inſtance and prayer of the Archbiſhop and other Prelates, was entred upon the Parliament-Roll, by the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with the Aſſent of the Lords Temporal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</q> This, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> will needs contend to be a <hi>Law</hi> of Parliament, (or a <hi>Law of the Land.</hi>) Why? Becauſe it was <hi>entred in the Roll or Journal-Book,</hi> that ſuch a thing was <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by the King and Two Houſes;</hi> 
               <q>Which (ſaith he) was all the Formality of paſſing Laws in Parliament,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> in thoſe times.</q> But what was it that the Biſhops petitioned might be <hi>entred</hi> upon the <hi>Parliament-Roll?</hi> Was it the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Canons,</hi> which debarr'd their preſence in the <hi>Houſe</hi> at ſuch Debates? <hi>That</hi> indeed had been ſomewhat to the purpoſe: but here was no ſuch matter deſired; it was their <hi>Proteſtation:</hi> and if every thing that is <hi>entred</hi> upon the <hi>Parliament-Roll</hi> by the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the King and the Two Houſes, becomes <hi>an Act of Parliament</hi> forthwith, then let this <hi>Protestation,</hi> for the <hi>preſent,</hi> paſs for an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; and we ſhall ſee anon what it will amount to.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66520:9"/>
            <p>In the Interim let us return to the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where there ſeems to be moſt colour for ſuch a Confirmation. There we may obſerve <hi>Two</hi> things in that 11th. <hi>Conſtitution, a Duty enjoyned,</hi> the Prelates <hi>attendance at the Kings Courts;</hi> and then a <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Priviledge</hi> indulged; <hi>That they may withdraw and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear that attendance, when it comes to ſentence for loſs of Life or Member.</hi> That <hi>this</hi> is a <hi>Priviledge</hi> or a <hi>Liberty,</hi> cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Mat.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Let. p. <hi>71.</hi>
               </note>; and this <hi>Gentleman</hi> could not chuſe but obſerve it, (though it was not for his purpoſe to diſtinguiſh this <hi>Priviledge</hi> from the <hi>Injunction</hi> 
               <q>One would think (ſaith he) they <hi>(the Biſhops)</hi> might look upon <hi>(it)</hi> as a Right and Priviledge, to be exempt from being obliged to attend in ſuch Caſes, Caſes of Blood.</q> It a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> then I may <hi>uſe</hi> or I may <hi>forbear</hi> it.

No man ſhould be <hi>compell'd</hi> to uſe his <hi>Priviledge;</hi> for then his <hi>Franchiſe</hi> would be no <hi>Liberty,</hi> but the more <hi>inthrall</hi> him. We may obſerve accordingly, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> very well underſtood this their <hi>Liberty;</hi> for ſometimes they would <hi>uſe</hi> their Priviledge, <hi>abſent</hi> themſelves, when <hi>Caſes Capital</hi> were upon <hi>Trial,</hi> and <hi>withdraw,</hi> when Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Blood</hi> were in agitation; and this is obvious to every eye in the peruſal of the <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Letters. But many times (which is very conſiderable in the Caſe) when they did <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,</hi> they either made a <hi>Proxy</hi> to repreſent them, or entered their <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to preſerve their <hi>Rights.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> does except againſt their way of <hi>Proxy's,</hi> as <hi>Unparlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary;</hi> and <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> exceptions he hath, which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to <hi>elude</hi> and Teſtimony: For either it is <hi>Error Temporis,</hi> an Errour of thoſe times; of ſpoken <hi>obiter,</hi> upon the By, and of no importance; or it is <hi>unparliamentary</hi> and extravagant, or elſe <hi>Repealed:</hi> Such a proviſion of <hi>Evaſions</hi> as may ſerve to help a man out of the <hi>Nooſe</hi> of any Argument that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Matters of this Nature.</p>

            <p>I muſt not forget to tell you of <hi>two Rules</hi> obſervable about ſuch <hi>Priviledges</hi> as are granted to Subjects by the King, as this of the <hi>Clarendon Conſtitution</hi> was to the <hi>Prelates.</hi> The firſt is, That <hi>they are not to be u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here we have 22 Precedents cited by this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> from the time of <hi>Clarendon Conſtitutions</hi> to the Trial of the E. of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> whereof <hi>one</hi> is a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Caſe; <hi>three</hi> are inſignificant and <hi>null,</hi> in regard there was either <hi>nothing</hi> at all done, or a <hi>ſtupid neglect</hi> of their <hi>Right,</hi> or a careleſs throwing off of all <hi>Duty. Four</hi> are doubtful; <hi>Ten</hi> are for their <hi>preſence</hi> at <hi>ſuch</hi> Trials, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>perſon</hi> under the Names and Titles of <hi>Biſhops, Prelates, Peers, Great men,</hi> or <hi>Lords of Parliament;</hi> or preſent <hi>virtually,</hi> by their <hi>Proxies,</hi> or their <hi>Proteſtations;</hi> ſo that ther are but <hi>four</hi> of all the 22, for their <hi>not appearing,</hi> or <hi>not voting</hi> at <hi>ſuch</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to all further enquiry or diſpute about this matter, we muſt take notice that the <hi>Canon</hi> which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Biſhops to <hi>withdraw</hi> at all Trials in <hi>Caſes Capital,</hi> is <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> are under no obligation to obſerve it. To ſay the <hi>Civil Sanction</hi> does ſtill <hi>enforce</hi> it, is abſurd; for what is that <hi>Civil Sanction</hi> but an <hi>Act of Parliament?</hi> and if an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament hath <hi>aboliſht</hi> it, it has likewiſe aboliſht all other Acts, which might ſeem to <hi>ratifie</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould be <hi>aboliſht,</hi> and <hi>not aboliſht,</hi> taken away, and yet in force ſtill; which are Contradictions, and abſurd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> takes notice of this to be the Biſhops <hi>Plea,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 67, 68.) <hi>That it is only by the Canon Law that this reſtraint is upon them, and that the forbearance of their Predeceſſors being Papiſts, and ſo ſubject to that Law, was only in that reſpect; which Law being of no force at preſent, and taken away by Act of Parliament, they are now at liberty, though in Modesty they think fit ſometimes to withdraw, but have a Right to continue ſitting if they pleaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What does the <hi>Gentleman</hi> anſwer to <hi>this?</hi> He ſaith, <hi>I do not deny but the Canon Law might give the firſt riſe to ſuch an Uſage; but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66520:12"/>it came afterward to receive a civil Sanction; the ſtamp of Parliament-Authority, and ſeveral confirmation,</hi> ibid. But I have evinced already that his <hi>Allegations</hi> do not prove what he pretends to undertake; and the <hi>practice</hi> of the Biſhops <hi>withdrawing</hi> at ſuch <hi>Trials,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other <hi>bottom</hi> to relie on than the <hi>Canon Law, That</hi> being abſolutely diſſolved and broken by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, cannot now ſupport it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Seeing there is no <hi>other</hi> Authority to <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>inure</hi> this practice but that <hi>Popiſh Canon,</hi> I ſhould think it a very dangerous thing (if the King ſhould be ſevere) for any perſon to attempt it; for upon the Clergies <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the King 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8.19. the <hi>Statute</hi> ſaith thus, [<hi>Be it therefore now enacted by Authority of this preſent Parliament, according to the ſaid ſubmiſſion and petition of the ſaid Clergy, that they nor any of them, from henceforth ſhall preſume to attempt, alledge, claim or put in ure any Conſtitutions or Ordinances, Provincials or Synodas,</hi> or <hi>any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, unleſs the ſame Clergy may have the Kings moſt Royal Aſſent and Licence—upon pain of every one of the ſame Clergy, doing contrary to this Act, and being thereof convict, to ſuffer impriſonment, and make fine at the Kings Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>thoſe</hi> Precedents above-mentioned, the next the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> meets with, was the Earl of <hi>Straffords,</hi> whoſe <hi>Trial</hi> in Parliament was <hi>compleated</hi> in <hi>a Judicial way;</hi> but he was <hi>attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> where this <hi>Gentleman</hi> does acknowledge a <hi>Right</hi> in the Biſhops to be preſent. Why they did <hi>then</hi> withdraw themſelves, ſuch as were not <hi>Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> or <hi>Obſervers</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> times, may beſt learn from Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the Author does <hi>proteſt,</hi> that he hath the very ſame <hi>Deſign, Aim,</hi> and <hi>Wiſhes</hi> with that <hi>Gentleman;</hi> for <hi>that Right may prevail is the natural wiſh of every good man.</hi> And the <hi>prevention</hi> of thoſe <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> which the <hi>Enemies</hi> to our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> have <hi>plotted,</hi> and do <hi>atchieve</hi> to put in <hi>execution,</hi> has <hi>incited</hi> me to this task <hi>to ſatisfie my ſelf and others, where the Right is.</hi> My Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents herein <hi>I</hi> humbly <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Honourable Court</hi> of Parliament; and if I have written any thing that gives a <hi>just cauſe of offence</hi> to my <hi>Superiors,</hi> I do here ſolemnly <hi>retract</hi> it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleman</hi> is <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> and leaves his Reader to his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> to weigh the Arguments on <hi>both</hi> Sides, and <hi>judge</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I have taken the <hi>freedom</hi> he allows me, and delivered my Opinion: I pray take you the <hi>ſame</hi> courſe without <hi>Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and then judge for your ſelf.</p>
